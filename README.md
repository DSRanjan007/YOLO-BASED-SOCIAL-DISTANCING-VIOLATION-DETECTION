# YOLO-BASED-SOCIAL-DISTANCING-VIOLATION-DETECTION

# OBJECTIVE
Covid 19 can be prevented if few
norms are followed properly
• Social Distancing is one of the
important norms to stops spreading
COVID-19.
• Advance Computer Vision technique
can be implemented to identified if
few persons are maintaining social
distance or not.
• This can be used to spread
awareness

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
• MAIN GOAL: To identify whether
the people are in adequate distance or
not.
• RED: High Risk; GREEN: Safe
• DISTANCE METRIC: Euclidean
Distance.
• Used deep learning technique.

# METHODS
• The backbone of our pre-trained
model is YOLO v3
• Here we use supporting weights for
the architecture trained with the
COCO data set.
• Measured the distance between two
persons using “Euclidean/L2
Norms”

# DATASET
• As the objective of the project is to work with CCTV footages, we
considered a real-world video as our dataset.
• The test dataset is a recorded video of 8408 number of frames
(720P - 30 FPS).

# FUTURE DIRECTION
• Face mask detection can be embedded.
• A bird eye view can be executed to help the local authority.
• A real time smart phone application can be developed (by using
Tensorflow Lite).
